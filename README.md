## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation

Before visualization, several preprocessing steps were applied in Excel and Tableau:

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removed missing or null entries in key columns such as `Age`, `Annual_Premium`, and `Vehicle_Damage`.
   * Standardized categorical variables for consistency (`< 1 Year`, `1-2 Year`, `> 2 Years`).
2. **Feature Creation**

   * Created bins for **Client Age** for grouped visual analysis.
   * Calculated average annual premium by **Vehicle Damage Status**.
3. **Data Aggregation**

   * Summarized total client counts by insurance type, gender, and interest status.

## üìä Dashboard Components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **KPI Cards (Donut Charts)**

These visual indicators summarize the key performance metrics for the business:

| **KPI**                                                 | **Description**                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Clients having Health Insurance**               | Clients currently holding health insurance (381.11K)                              |
| **Total Clients not Having Previous Vehicle Insurance** | Clients without prior vehicle insurance (174.6K)                                  |
| **Total Clients Interested in Vehicle Insurance**       | Clients expressing interest in purchasing vehicle insurance (46.7K)               |

Each donut chart visually represents the **percentage of total clients** in each category relative to the overall base population.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Vehicle Damage Percentage**

* **Visualization Type:** Stacked Bar Chart
* **Purpose:** Displays the percentage of vehicles reported as damaged versus undamaged, categorized by vehicle age.
* **Insight:** Older vehicles (>2 years) show a significantly higher damage rate (**~99%**) compared to newer ones, highlighting potential **higher risk segments**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Interactive Controls**

* **Age Bin Selector:** Slider filter to dynamically adjust client age grouping for deeper insights.
* **Vehicle Age Filter:** Allows the user to isolate data by vehicle age (`<1 Year`, `1‚Äì2 Year`, `>2 Years`).
